    <p>Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter is an American singer and songwriter. Born and raised in Houston, Texas, Beyoncé performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a 
        child. She rose to fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of Destiny's Child, one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of her first
        solo album, Dangerously in Love (2003), which featured the US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "Crazy in Love" and "Baby Boy". Following the 2006 disbandment of Destiny's
         Child, she released her second solo album, B'Day, which contained hit singles "Irreplaceable" and "Beautiful Liar". Beyoncé also starred in multiple films such as The Pink
          Panther (2006), Dreamgirls (2006), Obsessed (2009), and The Lion King (2019). Her marriage to Jay-Z and her portrayal of Etta James in Cadillac Records (2008) influenced her 
          third album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), which earned a record-setting six Grammy Awards in 2010. It spawned the successful singles "If I Were a Boy", "Single Ladies (Put a 
          Ring on It)", and "Halo". After splitting from her manager and father Mathew Knowles in 2010, Beyoncé released her musically diverse fourth album 4 in 2011. She later achieved 
          universal acclaim for her sonically experimental visual albums, Beyoncé (2013) and Lemonade (2016), the latter of which was the world's best-selling album of 2016 and the most 
          acclaimed album of her career, exploring themes of infidelity and womanism. In 2018, she released Everything Is Love, a collaborative album with her husband, Jay-Z, as the
           Carters. As a featured artist, Beyoncé topped the Billboard Hot 100 with the remixes of "Perfect" by Ed Sheeran in 2017 and "Savage" by Megan Thee Stallion in 2020. The same 
           year, she released the musical film and visual album Black Is King to widespread acclaim. Beyoncé is one of the world's best-selling recording artists, having sold 118 million
            records worldwide. She is the first artist to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 with their first six solo studio albums. Her success during the 2000s was 
            recognized with the RIAA's Top Certified Artist of the Decade as well as Billboard's Top Female Artist of the Decade. Beyoncé's accolades include 28 Grammy Awards, 26 MTV 
            Video Music Awards (including the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award in 2014), 24 NAACP Image Awards, 31 BET Awards, and 17 Soul Train Music Awards; all of which are more 
            than any other singer. In 2014, Billboard named her the highest-earning black musician of all time, while in 2020, she was included on Time's list of 100 women who 
            defined the last century.</p>

            <p>Beyoncé's success has led to her becoming a cultural icon and earning her the nickname "Queen Bey".In The New Yorker, music critic Jody Rosen described Beyoncé as 
                "the most important and compelling popular musician of the twenty-first century ... the result, the logical end point, of a century-plus of pop."Author James Clear, in his 
                book Atomic Habits (2018), draws a parallel between the singer's success and the dramatic transformations in modern society: "In the last one hundred years, we have seen the
                 rise of the car, the airplane, the television, the personal computer, the internet, the smartphone, and Beyoncé." The Observer named her Artist of the Decade (2000s) in 
                 2009. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Alex Suskind noticed how Beyoncé was the decade's (2010s) defining pop star, stating that "no one dominated music in the
                  2010s like Queen Bey", explaining that her "songs, album rollouts, stage presence, social justice initiatives, and disruptive public relations strategy have 
                  influenced the way we've viewed music since 2010." British publication NME also shared similar thoughts on her impact in the 2010s, including Beyoncé on 
                  their list of the "10 Artists Who Defined The Decade". In 2018, Rolling Stone included her on its Millennial 100 list.</p>
                
               <p> She is often credited for the cultural shift towards female pop singers rapping and for creating the staccato style of 'rap-singing' she used in songs like "Bug a
                    Boo" and "Say My Name". Uproxx stated that Beyoncé is the primary pioneer of the singsong style that dominates Hip-Hop currently, while Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork 
                    noticed her contribution in changing the sound of pop music radio with her hip-hop assisted style. Beyoncé's releases of Beyoncé in 2013 and Lemonade in 2016,
                     which are both concept albums and visual albums, have been credited with revolutionizing the music industry, reinventing the album and transforming how people
                      consume music. Beyoncé's work has influenced numerous artists including Adele, Ariana Grande, Camila Cabello, Iggy Azalea, Lady Gaga, and Rihanna. Gwyneth Paltrow
                       studied Beyoncé at her live concerts while learning to become a musical performer for the 2010 film Country Strong. 
                      She was known for coining popular phrases such as 'put a ring on it,' a euphemism for marriage proposal, 'I woke up like this,' which started a trend of 
                      posting morning selfies with the hashtag #iwokeuplikethis, and 'boy, bye,' which was used as part of the Democratic National Committee's campaign for the 
                      2020 election. Similarly, she also came up with the phrase "visual album" following the release of her fifth studio album, which had a video for every song.
                       This has been recreated by many other artists since, such as Frank Ocean and Melanie Martinez. The album also popularized surprise releases, with many
                        artists releasing songs, videos or albums with no prior announcement, such as Nicki Minaj, Eminem, Frank Ocean, Jay-Z and Drake. In January 2012, research
                         scientist Bryan Lessard named Scaptia beyonceae, a species of horse fly found in Northern Queensland, Australia after Beyoncé due to the fly's unique 
                         golden hairs on its abdomen. In 2018, the City of Columbia, South Carolina declared August 21 Beyoncé Knowles-Carter Day in the city after presenting
                          her with the keys to Columbia.</p>

            <p>Beyoncé started a relationship with Jay-Z after their collaboration on "'03 Bonnie & Clyde", which appeared on his seventh album The Blueprint 2: The Gift &
                The Curse (2002). Beyoncé appeared as Jay-Z's girlfriend in the music video for the song, fuelling speculation about their relationship.On April 4, 2008, Beyoncé and 
                Jay-Z married without publicity.As of April 2014, the couple had sold a combined 300 million records together. They are known for their private relationship, although they 
                have appeared to become more relaxed in recent years. Both have acknowledged difficulty that arose in their marriage after Jay-Z had an affair </p>
